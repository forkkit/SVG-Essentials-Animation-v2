>> Sarah Drasner: Take your last pen and make it interactive. So this could be a button click, if you wanna start really simple. You were working on a GreenSock timeline in the last one. You could just pause it and then have it restart with a button click. If you wanna make it more ambitious, you could try to hook it up to a slider.

You could try to hook it up to a draggable, dragging something else around the screen, it doesn't have to be a circle either, you could drag anything and control a timeline, so either way. But if it's more ambitious, you should try to make a thumbnail before you start so you have a plan.

Okay, so we'll do ten minutes for that one.
